## Intro

I've never had much luck with bead beating to extract yeast protein; it was always inefficient even with extended shaking, and I found it cumbersome overall.
Seeking an alternative, I found this chemical extraction method from the paper cited above, as outlined in the left branch of the paper's Figure 1 below.
It relies on a short, hot hydroxide + SDS treatment to hydrolyze the cell wall and solubilize protein...

...with a few small modifications for time and volume.
