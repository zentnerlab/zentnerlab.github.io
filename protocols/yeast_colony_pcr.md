# Yeast colony PCR

[Back to index](https://zentnerlab.github.io/)

1. Pick part of a colony into a PCR tube using a sterile pipet tip or toothpick. Mark the location of the picked colony with a dot and number on the bottom of the plate so you can go back and pick the rest of it to grow up for a glycerol stock if it is correct.

2. Microwave picked colonies on high for 1 min.

3. For each PCR, prepare the following reaction mix:
    * 5 μL 10X Standard Taq buffer (NEB M0273L)
    * 1 μL 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 mM each dNTP)
    * 1 μL 10 μM forward primer
    * 1 μL 10 μM reverse primer
    * 0.5 μL Taq polymerase (NEB M0273L)
    * 41.5 μL H<sub>2</sub>O

4. Add 50 μL PCR mix to each microwaved colony.

5. Cycle using the following parameters:
    * 95C, 5’
    * 35 cycles of:
    * 95C, 30”
    * 55C, 30”
    * 68C, 1’/kb
    * 68C, 5’
    * Hold at 8C

6. Add 10 μL 6X loading dye, pipet up and down to mix, and load 10 μL on an agarose gel.
