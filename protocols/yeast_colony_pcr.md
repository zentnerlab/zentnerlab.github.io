# Yeast colony PCR

[Back to index](https://zentnerlab.github.io/)

1. Pick part of a colony into a PCR tube using a sterile pipet tip or toothpick. Mark the location of the picked colony with a dot and number on the bottom of the plate so you can go back and pick the rest of it to grow up for a glycerol stock if it is correct.

2. Microwave picked colonies on high for 1 min.

3. For each PCR, prepare the following reaction mix:
    
    | Component | Volume |
    |-----------|--------|
    | 10X Taq buffer (NEB M0273L) | 5 μL |
    | 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 mM each) | 1 μL |
    | 10 μM forward primer | 1 μL |
    | 10 μM reverse primer | 1 μL |
    | Taq polymerase (NEB M0273L) | 0.5 μL |
    | H&#8322;O | 41.5 μL |

4. Add 50 μL PCR mix to each microwaved colony.

5. Cycle using the following parameters:

    | Step                      | Temperature  | Time     |
    |---------------------------|--------------|----------|
    | Initial denaturation      | 95C          | 5'       |
    | Amplification (35 cycles) | 95C          | 30"      |
    |                           | 55C          | 30"      |
    |                           | 68C          | 1'/kb    |
    | Final extension           | 68C          | 5'       |
    | Hold                      | 10C          | &#8734;  |
    
6. Add 10 μL 6X loading dye, pipet up and down to mix, and load 10 μL on an agarose gel.
