# Yeast colony PCR

1. Pick part of a colony into a PCR tube using a sterile pipet tip or toothpick. Mark the location of the picked colony with a dot and number on the bottom of the plate so you can go back and pick the rest of it to grow up for a glycerol stock if it is correct.

2. Microwave picked colonies on high for 1 min.

3. For each PCR, prepare the following reaction mix:
-5 μL 10X Standard Taq buffer (NEB M0273L)
-1 μL 10 mM dNTPs (2.5 mM each dNTP)
-1 μL 10 μM forward primer
-1 μL 10 μM reverse primer
-0.5 μL Taq polymerase (NEB M0273L)
-41.5 μL H2O

4. Add 50 μL PCR mix to each microwaved colony.

5. Cycle using the following parameters:
-95C, 5’
-35 cycles of:
-95C, 30”
-55C, 30”
-68C, 1’/kb
-68C, 5’
-Hold at 8C

6. Add 10 μL 6X orange loading dye (Lifetech R0631), pipet up and down to mix, and load 10 μL on an agarose gel.
