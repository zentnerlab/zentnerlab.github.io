# Yeast transformation

###### Note: if you are doing fewer than 5 transformations, you can cut the volumes in steps 2-4 and 7 in half.

1. The day before the transformation, inoculate 3 mL YPD or SC medium with a single colony. Grow overnight at 30C.

2. In the morning, dilute the overnight culture to OD600 = 0.3-0.4 in 50 mL YPD or SC medium. Grow 50 mL culture until OD600 = 1.0-1.2 (this should take 4-5 hr).

3. Pellet cells in a 50 mL conical tube at 3,000 x g for 3 min.  While cells are spinning, heat an aliquot of 2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA at 95C.

4. Wash cells with 50 mL H&#8322;O and pellet as above.

5. Resuspend cells in 1 mL H&#8322;O and transfer to a microfuge tube.  Flash spin to pellet cells.

6. Place denatured ssDNA in an ice/water bath.

7. Resuspend cells in 1 mL H&#8322;O, transfer 100 µL aliquots to new microfuge tubes, and pellet as above.

8. Prepare the following transformation mix for each sample, plus one extra:

    |                      | 1 transformation | 5 (+1) transformations |
    |----------------------|------------------|------------------------|
    | 50% w/v PEG-3350     | 240 µL           |	1440 µL                |
    | 1 M LiAc	           | 36 µL            |	216 µL                 |
    | Boiled 2 mg/mL ssDNA | 50 µL            |	300 µL                 |
    | DNA + H&#8322;O      | 34 µL	          | 204 µL                 |
    | Total	               | 360 µL           |	2160 µL                |

9. Add 360 µL transformation mix to each cell pellet and resuspend by vortexing.

10. Incubate the samples at 42C for 40 min.

11. Pellet cells at 6,000 x g for 30 sec.

12. Resuspend cells in 200 µL H&#8322;O and plate.
